Here’s a complete, step-by-step guide on how to handle each task you mentioned using Ubuntu, covering Jira + GitHub workflows including JQL and Git operations. Let’s break it down:


---

1. Create a Jira Story from a Feature Request and Assign It

> Assuming you're using Jira Cloud.



a. Manual via UI (easiest):

1. Go to your Jira project.


2. Click “Create”.


3. Fill in:

Issue Type: Story

Summary: e.g., “Add dark mode to user profile”

Description: Feature request details

Assignee: Choose the team member



4. Click Create.



b. Using Jira CLI (Optional):

If you want to automate:

jira create --project=ABC --type=Story --summary="Add dark mode" --description="Feature request to add dark mode in profile" --assignee=username


---

2. JQL: Find Issues Created Since Start of Week

created >= startOfWeek()


---

3. JQL: Show Issues Resolved in Previous Quarter and Previous Year

resolved >= startOfQuarter(-1) AND resolved < startOfQuarter()

resolved >= startOfYear(-1) AND resolved < startOfYear()


---

4. Merge Changes into Main Branch After Pull Request Approval

a. On GitHub (manual):

1. Go to the Pull Request.


2. After it’s Approved, click “Merge Pull Request” → “Confirm Merge”.



b. On Terminal (Ubuntu):

# Fetch latest changes
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Merge the PR branch (e.g., feature-xyz)
git merge feature-xyz

# Push to remote
git push origin main

5. More JQL Dynamic Date Functions

6. Work With a Forked Repository

a. Fork a Repo (on GitHub UI):

1. Go to the original repo → Click Fork → Select your account.



b. Clone the Forked Repo (on Ubuntu):

git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git
cd repo-name

c. Set Up Remotes:

git remote add upstream https://github.com/original-owner/repo-name.git
git fetch upstream

d. Create a New Branch and Push Changes:

git checkout -b feature-xyz
# Make code changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added dark mode"
git push origin feature-xyz

e. Send Pull Request (via GitHub UI):

1. Go to your forked repo on GitHub.


2. Click Compare & Pull Request.


3. Choose base: original repo’s main
compare: your feature branch.


4. Submit the PR.
